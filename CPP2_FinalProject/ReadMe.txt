What I have so far:
> I have a maze Generator that creates a solvable path, and creates random branches. 
> It also is playable with everytime you move in the maze. You can visually see where you are in the maze.

What I plan to add:
> While doing this project I had some ideas like adding a special item in the maze in where if you get it there is a special ending. 
> Also I'd like to know how to save progress if possible so you for replayability.
